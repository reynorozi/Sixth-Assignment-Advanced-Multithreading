### Question one

### A)
```java
Atomic Counter: 2000000
Normal Counter: 1976473
```
Because when we use an atomicCounter, the increment operation is performed in a safe and controlled way,
But if we use a normalCounter, it may lead to a race condition and produce an unexpected value.

### B)
To prevent race conditions and ensure that the correct value is returned.

### C)
This method uses the CAS (Compare-And-Swap) approach. It first reads the current value,
then checks whether the value is still the sameâ€”meaning no other thread has modified it. 
If the check passes, it safely increments the value. This mechanism ensures that no race condition has occurred.

### D)
In simpler cases, where we only want to avoid race conditions on a single variable,
 it makes sense to use atomic variables. However, when race conditions occur in more complex scenarios, it is better to use locks.

### E)
AtomicLong
AtomicBoolean
AtomicLongArray
AtomicIntegerArray

### Question Two
YES!
Because instead of having a single thread perform the task fifty million times, 
the workload is divided among five threads. Each thread performs a smaller portion of the task concurrently,
which naturally results in faster execution due to parallel processing.
